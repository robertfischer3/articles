# **Understanding S2C2F: The Emerging Framework for Secure Cloud Container Deployments**

**Robert Fischer**

***Note**: This is the first of many articles delving into implementing S2C2F. It will feature theory and practical infrastructure deployment code.*

## **Introduction**

Organizations are increasingly migrating to containerized applications in cloud environments, and as they do, security professionals face an increasingly complex landscape of security risks and compliance requirements. Container technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, and others have substantially transformed application deployment. DevSecOps teams can rapidly deploy complex applications with tie-ins to multiple services and systems. Further, if adequately architected and implemented, subsystems can be updated independently, and Container technologies like Docker and Kubernetes have transformed application deployment, making deployments more rapid, consistent, and repeatable. However, this capability has introduced new security challenges that traditional frameworks fail to address fully.

In a report sponsored by Black Duck and conducted by Ponemon Institute LLC, securing the software supply chain is essential to support containerized applications. From the report *The  State of Software Supply Chain Security Risks*, the importance is quite clear:

*According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a software supply chain attack can be as sophisticated as malware injection or as simple as an opportunistic exploitation of an unpatched vulnerability. The malicious code then ends up in an organization’s system and may allow the hacker to gain access to sensitive data or compromise its code to gain access to customers. This may result in a ransomware attack or other malicious incidents. Typically, attackers find a weak link in the supply chain and use it to move up or across the supply chain to their real targets.* 

*Vulnerabilities are the root cause of attacks against many of the software supply chains in this research. Fifty-nine percent of organizations in this research have been impacted by a software supply chain attack or exploit and 54 percent of these respondents say the attacks happened in the past year.*

(Ponemon Institute LLC, 2024)

The [Secure Supply Chain Compliance Framework](https://github.com/ossf/s2c2f/blob/main/specification/framework.md) (S2C2F) has recently emerged as a specialized response to these challenges. S2C2F provides structured guidance for organizations deploying containers in security-sensitive and regulated environments. S2C2F directly applies to financial services, healthcare, government, or any sector handling sensitive data. Understanding S2C2F has become increasingly critical for modern security architectures.

This article introduces the fundamentals of S2C2F, including compliance levels, and explains why it's gaining traction as an essential framework for organizations serious about container security and supply chain integrity. It is the first in a series of articles and open-source code implementations demonstrating S2C2F in considerable depth.

## **What is S2C2F?**

### **Origin and Purpose**

The Secure Supply Chain Compliance Framework (S2C2F) was developed in response to the growing recognition that container security requires specialized security approaches unique to the container space.  Container usage involves addressing the entire supply chain—from base images to runtime environments to project an organization. In August 2022, Microsoft contributed the [Secure Supply Chain Consumption Framework (S2C2F)](https://www.microsoft.com/securityengineering/opensource/osssscframeworkguide) to the [OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/).  Microsoft has been using S2C2F parallel with the Microsoft SDL to secure its development practices since 2019\. Following the supply chain attacks making headlines and increasing regulatory scrutiny, S2C2F aims to provide a comprehensive approach to securing containerized workloads across their lifecycle.

Unlike broader frameworks like NIST 800-53 or ISO 27001, S2C2F explicitly targets the unique security challenges of container environments and the software supply chains that support them. It draws upon established standards to focus on the risks associated with container registries, image management, and orchestration platforms. As such, implementing S2C2F provides detailed guidance that achieves the goals of the broader standards.

As stated in the document Secure Supply Chain Consumption Framework (S2C2F) Simplified Requirements, S2C2F has the following goals:

1. Provide a strong OSS governance program.  
2. Improve the Mean Time To Remediate (MTTR) to resolve known vulnerabilities in OSS.  
3. Prevent the consumption of compromised and malicious OSS packages.

## **The Eight Core Practices of S2C2F**

S2C2F is built around eight fundamental practices, each addressing a critical aspect of secure software supply chain management. While these core practices make sense independently, they should be considered an end-to-end process. Solid supply chain security can be achieved by viewing these practices as related, interlocking components, providing better control of the software development lifecycle and faster deployment and update agility. 

1. **Ingest**: Controlling how artifacts and dependencies enter your environment, creating a unified approach to consuming external components.  
2. **Inventory**: Maintaining a comprehensive inventory of your systems' software components, dependencies, and artifacts.  
3. **Update**: Establishing processes for timely updates to dependencies and containers when vulnerabilities are discovered.  
4. **Enforce**: Implementing policies and technical controls that enforce security standards across your environment.  
5. **Audit**: Conduct regular security audits and assessments of your supply chain systems and processes.  
6. **Scan**: Continuously scanning for vulnerabilities, malware, and security issues in containers and dependencies.  
7. **Rebuild**: Rebuilding components from trusted sources when necessary to ensure security.  
8. **Fix \+ Upstream**: Contributing security fixes to upstream open-source projects when vulnerabilities are discovered.

### **Key Principles of S2C2F**

At a high level, the eight core practices of S2C2F consists of generally accepted security controls.  A close examination of S2C2F reveals the following controls are present:

1. **Supply Chain Integrity**: Ensuring that all container ecosystem components \- from base images to dependencies \- come from verified sources and remain unaltered throughout their lifecycle.  
2. **Least Privilege Access**: Containers can provide a foothold for malicious attackers. S2C2F specifies fine-grained access controls for all container-related operations, from image pulling to deployment.  
3. **Continuous Verification**: Modern CI/CD processes can have tie-ins from multiple processes and repositories. S2C2F establishes ongoing monitoring and validation processes rather than point-in-time assessments to prevent vulnerabilities from being inserted into various processes.  
4. **Defense in Depth**: S2C2F specifies layering security controls across the container lifecycle to prevent single points of failure. Given the use of containers in CI/CD deployment, it should be no surprise that security ensures new vulnerabilities have not been introduced at any given stage.  
5. **Automation by Default**: Embedding security controls into automated pipelines to ensure consistent application and reduce human error. Not only can automation minimize human error, but if properly configured, automation can reduce the overall attack surface. 

These principles provide an interlocking set of controls and should be understood as such—principles 1 through 5 work together to ensure comprehensive security. One should note that this describes specific controls and an overall process with particular steps.  Future articles will demonstrate how S2C2F can be implemented as a secure enterprise process.

### **Relationship to Other Frameworks**

Does S2C2F replace other security standards? S2C2F complements rather than replaces existing security frameworks. It can be viewed as a specialized extension that addresses gaps in how traditional frameworks approach containerized environments. Rather than replacing existing frameworks, S2SC2F provides detailed controls that support the goals of these frameworks:

1. **NIST 800-53**: While NIST provides comprehensive security controls, S2C2F offers specific guidance on implementing these controls in container environments.  
2. **FedRAMP**: Organizations already pursuing FedRAMP compliance can use S2C2F to address container-related requirements specifically.  
3. **ISO 27001**: S2C2F provides technical specificity for container security, aligning with the broader information security management approach of ISO 27001\.  
4. **CNCF Best Practices**: S2C2F formalizes and extends many Cloud Native Computing Foundation security recommendations into a compliance framework.

For each of these standards, we can see how S2C2F offers specific guidance for implementing the standards above. Take, for example, [NIST 800-53](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53r5). 800-53 defines the access control families, broadly defining requirements for limiting system access to authorized users. It defines the controls under AC (Access Controls). As an aside, NIST also provides a [control catalog spreadsheet](https://csrc.nist.gov/files/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final/docs/sp800-53r5-control-catalog.xlsx), which aids in determining necessary control quickly. The larger NIST 800-53 document offers more depth but is a difficult read when getting started. (Joint Task Force Interagency Working Group, 2020\)

A concrete example of S2C2F's specificity to NIST 800-53 AC controls is how it translates these general controls into container-specific guidance. For instance, S2C2F specifies how to implement namespace isolation between containers. It also details specific Kubernetes Role-Base Access Control (RBAC) configurations. S2C2F even covers runtime settings to prevent privilege escalation and network policies for inter-container communication. S2C2F gives particular details to NIST 800-53 access controls. (Joint Task Force Interagency Working Group, 2020\)

Let's consider another example. NIST 800-53 topics include the configuration management (CM) control family. The CM family broadly converses baseline configuration and change control. While this is good, how do you determine the details needed to implement this family of controls for containers properly? Here again, S2C2F provides container-specific implementation guidance. S2C2F provides best practices for creating and maintaining secure container images and procedures for scanning container images for vulnerabilities. (Joint Task Force Interagency Working Group, 2020\)

Organizations pursuing FedRAMP compliance can also benefit by implementing S2C2F when cloud services utilize containerized architectures. A government-focused SaaS provider must meet FedRAMP's moderate requirements for the containerized application platform. One challenge that must be addressed is the implementation of FedRAMP continuous monitoring controls (based on NIST 800-53), where traditional monitoring approaches can not serve a dynamic containerized environment. They fall short. 

CNCF Best Practices: if you are unfamiliar with the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF),  you are missing out.  From their About page, “We bring together the world’s top developers, end users, and vendors and run the largest open source developer conferences. CNCF is part of the nonprofit [Linux Foundation](https://linuxfoundation.org/?__hstc=60185074.0e77818b4abaac96783aa9e4e3785403.1741470469796.1741470469796.1742685641240.2&__hssc=60185074.6.1742685641240&__hsfp=3718187366).” Opensource projects like Kubernetes, Argo, Dapr, Harbor, and Helm are graduated CNCF projects. Given that OpenSSF is a Linux Foundation project, it is hardly surprising that S2C2F supports CNCF Best Practices.  (*Software Supply Chain Security Best Practices V2*, 2024\)

The CNCF Best Practice documentation shows that general controls specified in NIST 800-53 items are also present in CNCF Best Practices. Both are covered in detail in the S2C2F standard. The upshot is that we can use S2C2F standards to achieve compliance with multiple security standards. 

## **The Four Maturity Levels of S2C2F**

**Question**: *My organization wants to move forward with S2C2F implementation. What are the next steps?* 

You will see that S2C2F is a comprehensive process with far-reaching security benefits. Given that the S2C2F scope of implementation is considerable, any organization should deploy S2C2F in phases. S2C2F has interlocking processes to provide comprehensive security. To attempt one overarching implementation introduces too much complexity for most organizations. Instead, implementation of S2C2F should seen in terms of maturity levels.  S2C2F defines four progressive maturity levels, each building upon the previous level to establish increasingly robust security controls. These levels allow organizations to implement container security in a staged approach, prioritizing the most critical controls first:

<img src="https://github.com/ossf/s2c2f/blob/main/images/maturity-level-white-bkg.png" alt="S2C2F Maturity Levels" width=60% title="S2C2F Maturity Levels">
(Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF), 2025\)

### **Level 1: Foundational Controls**

**Focus**: Basic governance of OSS components

Level 1 establishes minimal baseline requirements:

* Use of package managers to track dependencies  
* Basic inventory of OSS components  
* Vulnerability scanning  
* Regular updates to dependencies  
* Simple governance practices

Organizations at Level 1 have acknowledged the need for container-specific security and implemented essential controls. This level represents practices that many organizations already have in place. (Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF), 2025\)

### **Level 2: Enhanced Verification**

**Focus**: Improved governance and secure consumption

Level 2 extends security controls to include:

* Verification of package signatures and integrity  
* More comprehensive vulnerability scanning  
* Faster patching processes (improved MTTR)  
* Enhanced governance with clearly defined policies  
* Access controls for repositories and registries  
* Basic network segmentation

At this level, organizations address supply chain concerns more thoroughly by implementing verification mechanisms and focusing on reducing time to remediate vulnerabilities. (Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF), 2025\)

### **Level 3: Malware Defense**

**Focus**: Comprehensive supply chain security and protection against advanced threats

Level 3 represents a significant advancement in security maturity:

* Provenance tracking for all components  
* Automated policy enforcement  
* Advanced registry security  
* Integration with secrets management  
* Runtime container monitoring  
* Network policy enforcement  
* Regular penetration testing  
* Protection against malicious code

Regulated industry organizations often target Level 3, which addresses preventive and detective controls across the container lifecycle and protects against malicious packages. (Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF), 2025\)

**Note**: Level 3 maturity should suffice for most organizations. Given its general applicability, future articles will focus on the implementation needed to achieve it. I am developing an [open-source project](https://github.com/robertfischer3/scrutiny_secure_supply_aws) that will provide a turn-key solution for deploying the [Harbor](https://www.cncf.io/projects/harbor/), a cloud-native registry, as a component of Level 3 maturity. 

### **Level 4: Advanced Threat Defense**

**Focus**: Aspirational level with advanced threat protection capabilities

Level 4 implements sophisticated security measures:

* Rebuilding OSS on trusted infrastructure  
* Advanced runtime protection  
* Automated response to detected threats  
* Comprehensive audit logging and forensics  
* Complete supply chain verification  
* Strict change management  
* Private fixes for critical vulnerabilities when necessary

This level is designed for organizations handling highly sensitive data or operating in environments with elevated threat profiles. It is considered aspirational for most organizations due to its complexity and resource requirements. (Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF), 2025\)

## **Implementing S2C2F: A Maturity-Based Approach**

The maturity model approach of S2C2F enables organizations to:

1. **Assess Current State**: Evaluate your organization's maturity level across the eight practice areas.  
2. **Prioritize Actions**: Determine which controls to implement based on risk and business needs.  
3. **Incremental Improvement**: Progress through maturity levels in a structured manner rather than attempting to implement all controls simultaneously.  
4. **Risk-Based Customization**: Target specific maturity levels for different applications based on their risk profile and the sensitivity of the data handled.

The upcoming articles will help flesh out this framework in detail, allowing you to determine the following steps to deploy this comprehensive standard.

## **Conclusion**

The Secure Supply Chain Compliance Framework represents a significant evolution in our approach to security for containerized environments. By addressing the unique challenges of container supply chains and runtime environments, S2C2F provides organizations with a structured approach to mitigating risks that traditional frameworks may overlook.

S2C2F provides a comprehensive framework for securing containerized workloads and software supply chains. By implementing its practices across the four maturity levels, organizations can systematically improve their security posture and reduce the risk of supply chain attacks.

The framework's structured approach allows for incremental improvement, making it accessible to organizations at any stage of their security journey. As container adoption accelerates, frameworks like S2C2F will become increasingly important for security professionals securing modern application infrastructures.

In my next article, I'll share insights from developing an open-source S2C2F Level 3 compliant Harbor deployment for AWS using Terraform and Terragrunt as part of my work with fischer³. Stay tuned to learn how we're addressing the practical challenges of implementing these controls in production environments.
